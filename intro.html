1. HTML is the structure of the content of a webpage. Its purpose is to "markup" a documents/webpages.
2. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
3. HyperText is described as text that is displayed on an electronic device that can be linked to other text which is accessible to the user. Whenever you click on a link on a web page, you are taking advantage of HyperText linking.
4. A Markup Language is defined annotations that gets added to text that describes the text further. For example, if you were writing an essay, you would have headings, paragraphs, and embedded images. HTML has all the same things, and there is a defined format in which to represent the different parts of a document.

<!--
- This is the declaration for the HTML document type. It tells the web browser which version of HTML is being used. in our case HTML5
- DOCTYPE doesn't have a closing tag
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- =====================================================================================================-->

<!--
- The HTML element also called the root element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document.
- This starts the HTML document.
- All other elements must be descendants of this element
- has a closing tag
-->

<html>
</html>
<!-- =====================================================================================================-->
<!--
- The <head> element contains information about the document, such as machine-readable information aka(metadata) or extended information, the title of the document, and links to our style-sheet and links to fonts or icon's etc...
- can also put links to scripts (js files) but it's not best practice to do so. As code is read from top to bottom.
- metadata is not visible in the webpage/browser.

- In HTML, metadata is information about the web page that is not displayed directly to users, but is instead used by web browsers, search engines, and other tools to help understand and organize the content of the page. Metadata is typically included in the <head> section of an HTML document using various types of <meta> tags.

- <meta charset="UTF-8">
***** this meta tag specifies the character set encoding of the document.*****
https://www.dofactory.com/html/charset/utf8#:~:text=HTML%20CharSet%20Entities,as%20character%20encoding%20by%20default.

- There are reserved characters in html that we should try not to use. for example the < or > is a "reserved character because it represents and opening tag. Another example will be /. </> is used in every closing tag of an element in HTML document. A work-around this would be instead of using these special characters directly we can use character set entity.
-the most commonly used character set is the copyright sign. We can't create a copyright sign using our keyboard key. And so workout it would be to use the character set entity code. entity code for copy write &copy;
- something to point out, this is not something you should worry about remembering, because its hardly used. Also, every character set entity code begins with & (ampersand) and a ; (semicolon)

- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0 minimum-scale=1.0">
***** This meta tag specifies the viewport settings for the document. The viewport is the user's visible area of the web page, and this tag helps the browser adjust the layout of the page to fit different devices and screen sizes. ******

- <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
***** This meta tag sets the compatability mode for the document to the latest version of Internet Explorer.


- this is how page author metadata can be created
***** <meta name="author" content="John Doe" email="john.doe@example.com"> *****

- <meta> is a "void element" meaning it's a self-closing tag

Semantic Markup:
- Semantic markup in HTML refers to the use of HTML tags and attributes to convey the meaning or purpose of the content on a web page, rather than just its appearance.
- By using semantic HTML tags, web developers can create more meaningful and accessible web pages that are easier to navigate and understand for both humans and machines, like screen readers, for the visually impaired.
- lets take a look at an example:
<i> </i>   ==> by default, the contents of <i> element are italicized
<em> </em>  => by default, the contents of <em> element are also italicized
- they are both the same style visually. however the <em> element, is used to indicate text that has stress or importance, such as a key phrase or a word that is being defined.

-another example will be <b> vs <strong>    they both produce the same visual style.
- The <b> element is used to indicate text that should be visually bold, without any particular emphasis or importance.
- The <strong> element, on the other hand, is used to indicate text that has strong emphasis or importance that is also rendered in bold font, but carries a semantic meaning.

so remember:
- that the same visual result can be achieved using different combinations of markup and styles...
- the HTML element that best describes the data that it contains is the appropriate one for the job
- Keep in mind that there are other consumers of web pages besides web browsers!
    + screen readers, for the visually impaired
    + read the contents of the page to a user
    + not using appropriate elements, will not provide a good user experience

- we will see more examples of semantic markups shortly.

HTML 3
January 14, 1997
HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
HTML 4
December 18, 1997
HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]
April 24, 1998
HTML 4.0[20] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
December 24, 1999
HTML 4.01[21] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
May 2000
ISO/IEC 15445:2000[22][23] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).[22]
After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.
HTML 5
Main article: HTML5
October 28, 2014
HTML5[24] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[25]
November 1, 2016
HTML 5.1[26] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[27][28]
December 14, 2017
HTML 5.2[29] was published as a W3C Recommendation.[30][31]
HTML draft version timeline
October 1991
HTML Tags,[6] an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML tags, was first mentioned in public.
June 1992
First informal draft of the HTML DTD,[32] with seven[33][34][35] subsequent revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18, November 17, November 19, November 20, November 22)
November 1992
HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS revisions, which start with 1.1 rather than 1.0), an informal draft[35]
June 1993
Hypertext Markup Language[36] was published by the IETF IIIR Working Group as an Internet Draft (a rough proposal for a standard). It was replaced by a second version[37] one month later.
November 1993
HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet Draft and was a competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It expired in July 1994.[38]
November 1994
First draft (revision 00) of HTML 2.0 published by IETF itself[39] (called as "HTML 2.0" from revision 02[40]), that finally led to the publication of RFC 1866 in November 1995.[41]
April 1995 (authored March 1995)
HTML 3.0[42] was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)[43] without further action. It included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures, and the display of complex mathematical formulas.[43]
W3C began development of its own Arena browser as a test bed for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,[44][45][46] but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.[13] Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.[13] (see Browser wars). These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size, and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized."[13] Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."[13]
Official HTML5 logo
Logo of HTML5
January 2008
HTML5 was published as a Working Draft by the W3C.[47]
Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5 serialization.[48]
2011 HTML5 – Last Call
On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.[49] In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.[50]
2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation
In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.[51]
In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.[52] The criterion for advancement to W3C Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".[53]
2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation
In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.[54]
On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,[55] meaning the specification process is complete.[56]
XHTML versions
Main article: XHTML
XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0. It is no longer being developed as a separate standard.

XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26, 2000,[57] and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.
XHTML 1.1[58] was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on April 10, 2001.[59]
XHTML 2.0 was a working draft, work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on HTML5 and XHTML5.[60][61][62] XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update to XHTML 1.x.
An XHTML syntax, known as "XHTML5.1", is being defined alongside HTML5 in the HTML5 draft.[63]
Transition of HTML Publication to WHATWG
See also: HTML5 § W3C and WHATWG conflict
On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards.[64][65][66][67] The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions.[68] The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the de facto web standard for some time.[69]

Markup
HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like and, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.

The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
