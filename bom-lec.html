<!--The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a way for JavaScript to interact with the web browser.
- The window object is the core of the BOM and represents the web browser.
- Through the window object, we can control the browser's size and position, open pop-up windows, display system dialogs, or run interval-based processing. The window object also represents the JavaScript Global object, which means that any variables or functions declared in the global scope become part of the window object.

The BOM provides system dialogs such as alert(), confirm(), and prompt() which are made available through the window object. We can also execute code at a set interval of time or after a certain time interval has passed using the setInterval() and setTimeout() methods respectively.
- The setInterval() method allows code to be executed at a specified time interval until the method clearInterval() is called.
- And the setTimeout() method allows code to be executed after a specified time interval has passed and can be cancelled using the clearTimeout() method.-->
